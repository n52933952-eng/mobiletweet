# 🚀 QUICK START - What to Build Next

## ✅ App is Running! Now What?

### Option 1: Test Google Sign-In (Quick Test)
I'll create a simple test button to verify Firebase works!

### Option 2: Build Full Auth System (Production Ready)
I'll create the complete Twitter-style authentication:
- Welcome screen with Twitter logo
- "Sign in with Google" button
- Email/Password login
- Email/Password signup
- Connect to your backend

---

## 🎯 Which Do You Want?

### Quick Test (10 minutes):
- Add a Google Sign-In button to App.tsx
- Test if Firebase authentication works
- See if backend connection works
- Then build the full UI

### Full Authentication (1-2 hours):
- Complete Twitter-style UI
- Welcome → Login → Signup screens
- Google Sign-In + Email auth
- Backend integration
- Ready for production

---

## 💡 My Recommendation:

**Start with Quick Test**, then build full UI once we confirm everything works!

**Tell me which you prefer:**
1. "Quick test first" - I'll add a test button
2. "Build full auth" - I'll create all screens
3. "Show me both" - I'll explain both approaches
